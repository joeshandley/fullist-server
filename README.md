# Fullist Server

The backend for my project Fullist. The front-end repo for this project can be found here: https://github.com/joeshandley/fullist-client

## About

This server uses nodemon to continuously refresh the server when saving changes to the code.

In future I would like to add a database rather than static JSON files to allow for easy updating of stock and recipes details.

## How to run

1. Clone this repo along with the accompanying client
2. Input `npm i` into the console to download all required npm packages
3. Create a .env file using the .env.example file as a template
4. Input `npm start` into the console to initate the server
5. Enjoy finding where you can get your full list! ðŸ¥³
